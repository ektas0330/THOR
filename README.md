# Persistent Homology Meets Object Unity: Object Recognition in Clutter

Code repository for the methods presented in Persistent Homology Meets Object Unity: Object Recognition in Clutter.

## Dataset

The UW Indoor Scenes (UW-IS) Occluded Dataset proposed in the above paper for systematically evaluating object recognition methods under varying environmental conditions can be found [here](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.20506506). This dataset, which is recorded using commodity hardware, consists of two different indoor environments, multiple lighting conditions, and multiple degrees of clutter.
